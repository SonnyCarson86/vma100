        The Ferrari 308 GTB berlinetta and targa topped 308 GTS are V8 mid-engined, two-seater sports cars manufactured by the Italian company Ferrari from 1975 to 1985. The Bertone designed 308 replaced the Dino 246 GT and GTS in 1975 and was
        updated
        as the 328
        GTB/GTS in 1985. The similar 208 GTB and GTS were equipped with a smaller, initially naturally aspirated and later turbocharged, two-litre engine, and were sold mainly in Italy. <br> <br>

        <strong>Ferrari 308</strong><br><br>
        The 308 had a tube frame with separate body. The 308 GTB/GTS and GT4 were mechanically similar, and also shared much with the original Dino. Both 308s sit on the same tube platform, however the GT4—being a 2+2—has a longer wheelbase. The
        engine
        was a V8 of a 90 degree configuration, with two belt-driven overhead
        camshafts per cylinder bank. It was transversely mounted in unit with the transaxle transmission assembly, which was below and to the rear of the engine's sump. All models used a fully synchromesh[2] 5-speed "dog-leg" manual gearbox and a
        clutch-type limited slip differential. Suspension was all-independent, comprising double wishbones, coaxial coil springs and hydraulic dampers, and anti-roll bars on both axles; four wheel vented disc brakes were also fitted. Steering was
        unassisted rack and pinion.<br>
        The 308's body was designed by Pininfarina's Leonardo Fioravanti, who had been responsible for some of Ferrari's most celebrated shapes to date such as the Daytona, the Dino and the Berlinetta Boxer. The 308 used elements of these shapes to
        create something very much in contrast with the angular Bertone-designed GT4. GTS models featured a removable roof panel with grained satin black finish, which could be stowed in a vinyl cover behind the seats when not in use.<br><br>

        <strong>Ferrari 208</strong><br><br>
        In 1980 Ferrari introduced a two-litre version of the 308, 208 GTB and 208 GTS. They were mainly for the domestic Italian market, where new cars with engines above 2 litres were subjected to a much higher value added tax, 38% instead of the
        standard 18%.[12] They were also listed in Portugal and New Zealand. The 208 GTB/GTS replaced the 208 GT4 2+2. It is often regarded as the slowest Ferrari ever made but was proved faster than the 208 GT4 Bertone in a 1980 test by American
        magazine Motor Trend. The engine was de-bored to 66.8 mm (giving it an undersquare design) for a total displacement of 1,990.64 cc (121 cu in),[13] resulting in one of the smallest V8 engines ever produced. Fed through four Weber 34 DCNF
        carburettors, the V8 produced 155 PS (114 kW; 153 bhp) at 6800 rpm.[14] 160 208 GTS and 140 208 GTB cars were produced in 1980 and 1981.
