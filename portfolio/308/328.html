        The Ferrari 328 GTB and GTS (Type F106) are mid-engine V8, two seat sports cars created by Italian automobile manufacturer Ferrari. It was the successor to the Ferrari 308 GTB and GTS.
        While mechanically still based on the 308, modifications were made to the body, chassis, and engine, most notably an increase in engine displacement to 3.2 L for increased power and torque output.
        The 328 is still considered by some enthusiasts to be one of the most reliable and functional Ferraris; unlike other models, much of its maintenance can be performed without lowering the engine from the vehicle. <br>
        <br><br>
        The 308 and 328 are considered a family of Ferrari road cars as they share similar (but not identical) body designs and appearances, chassis, and engine designs. Essentially the new 328 model was a revised and updated version of the 308,
        which
        had survived for eight years without any radical change to the overall shape, albeit with various changes to the 3-litre engine.<br>
        The 328 was the final evolution of the transversely mid-mounted, conventionally aspirated 90 degree V8 Dino engine. The transversely mounted engine is a popular way to save space on the rear-mid, rear wheel drive layout.
        The 328 has been described as one of the most usable classic Ferraris because of its durable road record, history of appreciating value, and classical aesthetics.
