        The 208 GTS/B, 288 GTO, 308 GTS/B, 328 GTS/B, 365 GT/4 BB and BB 512 were all Mid Engine Berlinetta and Targa Top 2+2 Coupes designed for Pininfarina by Leonardo Fioravanti in Turin, Italy, and built by Ferrari in Maranello, Italy between
        1973
        and 1989. While these cars may vary little in appearance, each version had unique engine and chassis configurations, lending to each vehicle having a unique driving experience.
        <br><br>
        Debuted at the 1971 Turin Motor Show as the Ferrari 365 GT/4 BB, the body style entered production in 1973. This configuration was the first Ferrari-badged production car to feature a mid engine platform, a design that was adopted from the
        widely succesful, Ferrari Produced and Pininfarina designed Dino 206/246 and the Bertone designed Dino 308. The body style ended in 1989 when the Ferrari 328 was replaced by Fioravanti's Ferrari 348 Type F119 Design. However, to this day mid
        engine configurations are
        the standard for Ferrari production cars. <br><br>
