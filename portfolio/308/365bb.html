        The Ferrari Berlinetta Boxer (BB) is a sports car that was produced by Ferrari in Italy between 1973 and 1984.
        Replacing the front engined Daytona, it was the first in a series of Ferraris to use a mid-mounted flat-twelve engine.
        The Boxer was designed by Leonardo Fioravanti and was the first mid-engined road-car to bear the Ferrari name and the Cavallino Rampante (prancing horse) logo.
        It was replaced by the Testarossa, which continued to use the flat-twelve engine.<br><br>
        <br><br>
        <strong>365 GT/4 BB</strong><br><br>
        The first "Boxer" was the 365 GT/4 BB shown at the 1971 Turin Motor Show. Designed to rival the Lamborghini Miura and the newly developed Lamborghini Countach, it was finally released for sale in 1973 at the Paris Motor Show. 387 were built,
        of
        which 88 were right-hand drive (58 of those for the UK market), making it the rarest of all Berlinetta Boxers.The Pininfarina-designed body followed the P6 show car with popup headlights.Though it shared its numerical designation with the
        Daytona, the Boxer was radically different. It was a mid-engined car like the Dino, and the now flat-twelve engine was mounted longitudinally rather than transversely (as it was mounted in the Dino; the Daytona was a conventional
        front-engine,
        longitudinal design). The engine produced 380 PS (279 kW; 375 hp), slightly more than the Daytona. The engine shared its internal dimensions with the V12 from the Daytona, but was spread out to 180° as on Ferrari's 1970 Formula One car and
        was
        mounted above a five-speed manual transmission. One major difference in this engine was its use of timing belts rather than chains. Although referred to as a Boxer, the 180° V12 was not a true boxer engine, but rather a flat engine.
        <br><br>
        <strong>BB 512/512i</strong> <br><br>
        The 365 GT4 BB was updated as the BB 512 in 1976, resurrecting the name of the earlier Ferrari 512 racer. The name 512 referred to the car's 5 litre, 12 cylinder engine; a deviation from Ferrari's established practice of naming 12-cylinder
        road
        cars (as the 365 BB) after their individual cylinder displacstrongent. The engine was enlarged to 4943 cc,[3] with an increased compression ratio of 9.2:1. Power was slightly down to 360 PS (265 kW; 355 hp), while a dual plate clutch handled
        the added torque and eased the pedal effort. External differentiators included a new chin spoiler upfront, incorporated in the bumper. A NACA duct on the side provided cooling for the exhaust syststrong. At the rear there were now twin tail
        lights and exhaust pipes each side, instead of triple units as on the 365 GT/4 BB.[4] 929 BB 512 models were produced.
        <br><br>
        The Bosch K-Jetronic CIS fuel injected BB 512i[5] introduced in 1981 was the last of the series. The fuel injected motor produced cleaner strongissions and offered a better balance of performance and driveability. External differentiators
        from
        the BB 512 besides badging include a change to metric sized wheels and the Michelin TRX metric tyre syststrong, small white running lights in the nose (grill), and red rear fog lamps outboard of the exhaust pipes in the rear valance. 1,007 BB
        512i models were produced.
